            Chronic diseases, such as Diabetes, Cardiovascular diseases, hypertension have specific characteristics including increasing incidence rate, long term intervention requirement and multi-disease complications/comorbidities. Chronic Disease Management (CDM) is a series of actions designed to manage or prevent a chronic condition using a systematic approach to care and potentially employing multiple treatment modalities. Due to the internal and external complexity factors of managing chronic conditions, such as how to enable early risk identification of conditions, how to build precision medicine and decision support process, and how to support patient management at scale. With the emerging of advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, they are becoming promising means to deal with the challenges among CDM practices. This workshop tries to discuss whether and how AI technologies can address challenges among the whole chronic disease management cycle. To concentrate, it will focus on Diabetes, and touch topics about the prevention, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and engagement of Diabetes.

          <div class="custom_container">
            A chronic condition is a human health condition or disease that is persistent or otherwise long-lasting in its effects which requires special training and management of the patient for rehabilitation or care. Although there are variations among definitions from institutes in different countries, the common set of chronic diseases include cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, hypertension, and cancer etc. The number of people with chronic conditions is rapidly increasing. In the United States, 133 million Americans have at least one chronic disease. The China Health Management and Health Industry Development Report (2018) shows that the number of chronic disease patients in China is around 300 million, and the proportion of deaths due to chronic diseases in urban and rural areas is as high as 85.3% and 79.5% respectively. 
Chronic Disease Management (CDM) is a series of actions designed to manage or prevent a chronic condition using a systematic approach to care and potentially employing multiple treatment modalities. Increasingly people with chronic diseases are being managed in primary care by general practitioners and other primary health care professionals often in collaborative arrangements with specialized services. 
<!-- The complexity of chronic conditions requires the implementation of CDM systems considering at least the following perspectives:
<ul class="">
  <li>Proactive and Preventive</li>
  <li>Well integrated with primary care and  community </li>
  <li>Coordinated across providers and points of care</li>
  <li>Easily accessible</li>
  <li>Team-based</li>
  <li>Has a focus on health promotion and well being</li>
  <li>Encourages individual and families involvement</li>
</ul> -->

Today, Artificial Intelligence (AI) defined by modern dictionary the theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages. Artificial intelligence has created new opportunities for discovering insight faster and transforming industries at scale by bringing argumented intelligence to assist human being and professions, in data and knowledge intensive industry like healthcare, AI has been acted as an important proposition to handle healthcare challenges such as drug discovery, real word evidence, clinical decision support etc. With the global growing demands on helping chronic disease patients, AI enabled chronic disease management has got strong attraction from both academic and industries. Taken diabetes as the example, AI technologies have been applied for diabetic retinopathy screening for diabetes patients.
